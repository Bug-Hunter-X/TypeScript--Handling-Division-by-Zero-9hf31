# TypeScript: Division by Zero Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in TypeScript: division by zero. The code includes a `divide` function that throws an error when attempting to divide by zero.  The solution shows how to implement robust error handling for this scenario.

The `bug.ts` file contains the original code with the division by zero error.  The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a solution incorporating more robust error handling.
